### Project Description
Our healthcare project assesses lab reports to determine whether results are normal, high, or low, offering graphical representations and lifestyle suggestions. It features an AI-powered chatbot that creates personalized diet recipes based on thyroid, cholesterol, renal function, and blood pressure results. Additionally, it includes real-time BP monitoring with alerts for instability, doctor details, and informative health articles.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People struggle with understanding complex medical reports and forget to eat healthily even when their health depends on it. On top of that, keeping track of BP fluctuations is a full-time job nobody signed up for!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a one-stop healthcare companion that decodes your lab reports, gives graphical insights, and even becomes your personal dietitian by crafting custom meal plans. It monitors your BP like a hawk, alerts you when things go haywire, and even connects you to doctorsâ€”because why should staying healthy be boring?

The Renal Function Analysis page allows users to input lab values (Creatinine, BUN, eGFR, etc.) to receive a comprehensive kidney health assessment. The app generates a report with graphical analysis of the user's values compared to normal ranges, along with personalized diet and exercise recommendations. This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns.

![Screenshot2](Add screenshot 2 here with proper name)
The Real-time Monitoring feature connects to compatible smartwatches to display live heart rate data (BPM), calculates heart rate zones, and sends alerts for unusual fluctuations. Historical data is stored for trend analysis. This feature is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for medical advice. Consult a doctor for health concerns.

![Screenshot3](Add screenshot 3 here with proper name)
The AI Chatbot provides personalized recipe recommendations based on user dietary restrictions, allergies, and health goals. Users can interact conversationally to find recipes, view details (ingredients, instructions, nutrition), and save favorites. This tool is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional dietary advice. Consult a dietitian for personalized guidance.

![Final](Add photo of final product here)
This project delivers a comprehensive health management web app where users can analyze lab reports (Thyroid, Renal, Cholesterol) with graphical results and personalized recommendations, chat with an AI chatbot for health info, monitor heart rate in real-time (smart device connection & alerts), find and book doctor appointments by department, and access health articles. Deployed at [your URL or "run locally"], the app provides a user-friendly interface (HTML, CSS, JS frontend) and a robust backend (Node.js/Express.js, MongoDB). Users can easily navigate the features to manage their health data and access vital information.

This video demonstrates our comprehensive health management app. We'll showcase signup/login, then dive into key features: Lab Report Analysis (including Thyroid, Renal, and Cholesterol tests with graphical results and personalized recommendations), AI Chatbot, Real-time Monitoring (smart device connection and alerts), Doctor Appointments (by department), and a health articles section. Our app empowers users to manage their health with convenient access to vital information and tools.
